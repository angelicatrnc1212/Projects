Description: 
The program is used to get information regarding the OS. It is also written to being able to get the average value over a period of time and per inputted periodic samples.
--------------------------------


Running my solution:
1. Open your VM (I'm using UBUNTU), make sure you have a compiler installed
2. Change the directory to the src folder
3. Type in 'gcc -I../include main.c -o main' to compile the file 
4. To execute, type './main'
5. If you want to use sampling, type './main x y' with  x as an integer for every second, and y as a double for the period of time
--------------------------------


Compiler & OS:
Any Linux based operating system software
--------------------------------


Assumptions:
While writing this program, I am assuming the user types in an appropriate input for the sampling time and there are minimum error on the OS outputs.
--------------------------------


Errors/Bugs: None as known
